"Crash Course Python" by Eric Matthes

Exercise 19-1. Blog: Start a new Django project called Blog. Create an app called blogs in the project and a model called BlogPost. The model should have fields like title, text, and date_added. Create a superuser for the project, and use the admin site to make a couple of short posts. Make a home page that shows all posts in chronological order.

Create a form for making new posts and another for editing existing posts. Fill in your forms to make sure they work.

PART 2: 

19-2. Blog Accounts: Add a user authentication and registration system to the Blog project you started in Exercise 19-1 (page 421). Make sure logged-in users see their username somewhere on the screen and unregistered users see a link to the registration page.
