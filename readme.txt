"Crash Course Python" by Eric Matthes

Exercise 19-1. Blog: Start a new Django project called Blog. Create an app called blogs in the project and a model called BlogPost. The model should have fields like title, text, and date_added. Create a superuser for the project, and use the admin site to make a couple of short posts. Make a home page that shows all posts in chronological order.

Create a form for making new posts and another for editing existing posts. Fill in your forms to make sure they work.

PART 2: 

19-2. Blog Accounts: Add a user authentication and registration system to the Blog project you started in Exercise 19-1 (page 421). Make sure logged-in users see their username somewhere on the screen and unregistered users see a link to the registration page.

PART 3: 
19-5. Protected Blog: In your Blog project, make sure each blog post is connected to a particular user. Make sure all posts are publicly accessible but only registered users can add posts and edit existing posts. In the view that allows users to edit their posts, make sure the user is editing their own post before processing the form.

PART 4:
20-2. Stylish Blog: Use Bootstrap to style the Blog project you created in Chapter 19.
